**How can an organization prioritize millions of small to large maintenance
 expenditures over a 50-year period?**

I am a Senior Software Developer
at [Copperleaf Technologies](http://www.copperleaf.com/) in Vancouver, Canada,
for Copperleaf's C55 product. I work primarily with C#, Oracle, and Python. 
C55 is Copperleaf's core enterprise product: Premium
software that empowers large-scale organizations with **Decision Analytics for
Asset Investment Planning and Management**.

I am also involved with Research and Development on Decision Analytics. We
provide solutions that are critical to the effective and safe operation of large
infrastructure and utility companies. For example, How can an organization
prioritize millions of small to large maintenance expenditures over a 50-year
period? and, **How should an organization quantify and mitigate risk?** Such
questions must be answered, and the solutions rolled into Copperleaf's software
products.

### My Academic Side ###

Over 6 years with 26 co-authors I published 8 journal papers, 9 conference
papers, covering topics in combinatorics, theoretical computer science, and
networks, and I have several research papers in the pipeline.

I did my graduate degrees at the University of Waterloo and the University of
Victoria, followed by a 3-year postdoc
at
[Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/ecs/ "Durham University School of Engineering and Computing Sciences") in
the UK.

Much of my research is on **datacenter networks and theoretical computer
science**. I provided the central idea for several of my research group's
[ major projects ](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02181 "The Stellar Transformation:
From Interconnection Networks to Datacenter Networks") and
[publications on datacenter networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01747 "Routing
Algorithms for Recursively-Defined Data Centre Networks") and I take a lead-role
in visioning and planning future research paths for our team. I am also a major
contributor to the open-source software
[INRFlow](https://bitbucket.org/alejandroerickson/inrflow "INRFlow Release
Versions"), implemented in C, which we have used for **analysing and simulating
large-scale datacenter networks**.

My research interests include cloud computing, big data, datacenter networks,
combinatorial algorithms, computational geometry, graph theory, and tilings and
coverings.

As a PhD student I pioneered the area of tatami tilings, the combinatorial
geometry problem of laying down square- and domino-shaped tiles such that no
four of them touch corners. My work has provided paths to further mathematical
discoveries, inspired student projects, and fuelled investigations by other
researchers, including Don Knuth. I received **over $40,000 in university fellowships and scholarships**, and I was **nominated by the University of Victoria
for one of Canada's top PhD grants, the Vanier Canadian Graduate
Scholarship (CGS)**.

As a scientist I create and disseminate knowledge. Sharing my discoveries
through publications, source code, blog posts, and instructional videos is
paramount to my participation in the philosophy that knowledge for the common
good must be shared. That's why **promoting math and computer science has been at
the centre of my volunteer work**.

I created a [brand](http://geoburst.ca/ "Geoburst") to promote mathematics, and I developed activities
and demonstrations that have been experienced by over 5000 participants through
over 100 of my own presentations and those of Math Catcher, a math outreach
program targeting First Nations, led by
[multi-award](https://cms.math.ca/MediaReleases/2012/et-announcement "Veselin
Jungic to Receive the 2012 CMS Excellence in Teaching Award")
[winning](https://www.pims.math.ca/news/sfus-veselin-jungic-awarded-2011-pims-education-prize
"SFU's Veselin Jungic awarded 2011 PIMS Education Prize")
[educator](http://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2015/jungic-veselin-appointed-3m-national-teaching-fellow.html
"Veselin Jungic appointed 3M National Teaching Fellow")
[Prof. Veselin Jungic](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~vjungic/ "Prof. Veselin's
webpage").  I have collected hundreds of thank-you messages from students,
teachers, and parents, but here is some of Veselin's praise:

> Writing this reference letter feels bittersweet. On the one hand I feel
> honoured that I am asked to share with the community my opinion about one
> extraordinary man that I have had the privilege of calling my student,
> collaborator, and friend. On the other hand, I am aware that our work in the
> Math Catcher program is coming to an end and that I am to face a difficult
> challenge of replacing Mr. Erickson as a member of the Math Catcher team.

I have a **3D printer, with which I created a
[mechanical realisation of my PhD work]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url

"TatamiMaker Slidecast and paper").**

[I make coffee using a 36kg lever espresso machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1P1ke_PVaw
"Me, making Coffee in 2016"). It provides 4 or 5 sacred moments every day, where
I enter a trance-like state, weighing beans, grinding, levering, timing,
watching, and finally sipping the sweet nectar. It's something of an obsession.

I am married and we have a bilingual son (as far as a 2-year-old is lingual at
all).

#### Teaching and leadership ####

I have worked extensively on math and computer science outreach and I have
lectured at the undergraduate and (post)graduate levels. In 2015 I worked with
[The Brilliant Club](http://www.thebrilliantclub.org/) to deliver a 5-day mini
course on my Ph.D. research at a high school in the UK. The results were very
positive. I have also worked with
[Math Catcher](http://mathcatcher.irmacs.sfu.ca/) in Canada, and led my own
initiative, [GeoBurst](http://geoburst.ca/), through which we did mathematical
activities with over 1000 students and educators.

I am compelled to share the joys of math and computer science with students, and I
believe that doing so is a great benefit to both them and myself.
