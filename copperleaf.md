In 2017 I started developing software and doing industrial research for a
late-stage startup that makes software for power utilities. Let me tell you
about my job at Copperleaf and give you a few reasons to apply here.

Power utilities manage enormous quantities of Assets, from pipes and power poles
to turbine generators and nuclear reactors. Naturally, there are risks
associated with the Assets as they age, and there are limited resources that can
be used to maintain and replace them. Copperleaf's main product, C55, is based
on the ISO 55000 standard for asset management. It layers prescriptive analytics
for prioritizing spend on top of a sophisticated application for managing a
utility's population of Assets and the Investments employed to maintain it.

**We sign multi-million dollar deals with our customers, and our software
transforms the way they make decisions.**

### Company culture, exciting growth, and technical challenges defined 2017 at Copperleaf.###

Here are a few quick facts about our amazing 2017:

  * **Employee bonuses were paid at over 150% of target.**
  * We grew by almost 100% in revenue.
  * We added 9 new companies to our list of customers.

Great Company Culture is the foundation underpinning excellence, camaraderie,
and a sense of pride at Copperleaf. Our CEO,
[Judi Hess](https://www.copperleaf.com/leadership/judi-hess/), has been a leader
in this area since her days as President of CREO and she personally delivers our
training session on Company Culture. It is a joy to work with these people.

Copperleaf is a late-stage startup with a fast-growing, stable customer base. I
attribute our early success to the experience of a core group of former CREO
employees but there are many forces working in our favour.
**We hire and retain
great people and our customers on five different continents love and need our
software.**

Technical challenges and career opportunities are a critical part of employee
retention, and there are lots of both at Copperleaf. My own roles have
varied, from UI work in Angularjs to building a .NET-Oracle SQL rocket engine
that drives a custom data-analysis tool for a new customer with 5 million
Assets. I also work outside of the main product, organizing professional
development days in Machine Learning, consulting internally in statistics, and
researching prototypical decision analytics engines using Python and Pandas. The
list of new things I learnt in the first year of my job is nearly a page long,
and I think there is at least that much on the horizon for the next year.

We are about 50-80 developers, and a similar number of people in sales, marketing and
customer support at our Vancouver office at the Broadway Tech Centre.
It is a great time to join Copperleaf, so browse our
[careers page](http://www.copperleaf.com/careers/) and get in touch with me if
you want to apply. I get a fat referral bonus if you make it, so I'll champion
your application before HR and the team you apply to.
