  I am inventor, educator, artist, and I develop Decision Analytics software for Copperleaf Technologies.
  When I am not doing research, coding, or using the 3D printer I am making espresso coffee, taking pictures,
  making geometric sculptures, building drones, or reading to my son in Spanish.
tagline: Sorry for the migration mess, still figuring things out.
