<div class="post-text">
<p>Quite often when I discuss math problems with other  mathies, they make a connection I had not seen or they have an approach  to solving it that I had not thought of.  Although I'm sure this happens  to most of us, I find myself wondering why I hadn't thought of that.</p>
<p>So my question is (since I can't ask for a better innate mathematical intuition at this point):</p>
<p>Do you have a story of how you trained to improve your mathematical intuition?</p>
<p>Did you read certain books?  How did you read them?</p>
<p>Did you take on a certain attitude?</p>
<p>Did you do more math problems in your free time?</p>
<p>Did you listen to tapes at night? (just kidding :D)</p>
<p>Also, comment if you have the same question.</p>
