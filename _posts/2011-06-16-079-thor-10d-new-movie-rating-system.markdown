<p>Walking past the theatre yesterday, I saw they were showing</p>
<h1>THOR 3D</h1>
<p>I laughed out loud, and continued walking.  But thinking back over the last year or two, I can make the obvious  observation that every movie titled</p>
<h1>&lt;insert title here&gt; 3D</h1>
<p>is on the same intellectual plane as THOR 3D.  These movies are self-declared unintelligent!  Tough, perhaps THOR 3D deserves more Ds.  I propose this as a rating system for film festival lovers, and I think THOR 3D should be renamed to</p>
<h1>THOR 10D</h1>
