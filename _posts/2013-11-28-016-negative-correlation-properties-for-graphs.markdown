This is on my Master's thesis. A paper I published later has the following
abstract: "We provide new evidence that spanning forests of graphs satisfy the
same negative correlation properties as spanning trees, derived from Lord
Rayleigh's monotonicity property for electrical networks. The main result of this
paper is that the Rayleigh difference for the spanning forest generating
polynomial of a series parallel graph can be expressed as a certain positive sum
of monomials times squares of polynomials. We also show that every regular matroid
is independent-set-Rayleigh if and only if every basis-Rayleigh binary matroid is
also independent-set-Rayleigh." Find the paper at http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3660
