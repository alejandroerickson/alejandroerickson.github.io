# It's sugar cane season! #

Chewing on stalks of raw sugar cane was a wonderful part of my childhood in
Vancouver, and while visiting my home town today, I came across this delight
once again. This time, however, I've made a delicious drink for grown-ups.

**Simply mix sugar cane with rye whisky at a ratio of about 4:3.**

 The juice from about one section of the sugar cane should yield around 40ml of
liquid, so this is enough for a single shot (30ml) of whisky. Chill the rye and
the sugar cane. Extracting the juice from the cane (without chewing it) is a
little challenging. I used a large heavy duty garlic press and it was
considerable work. A conventional vegetable and fruit juicer would do it, I'm
sure, as well as industrial cane juicers.
