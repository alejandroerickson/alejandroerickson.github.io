I created a BibDesk template which exports some code executable in Sage. The
output is a graphic with authors on the left connected by lines to their
publications on the right.

 It is good for familiarising yourself with the authors of your bibliography.

 To use it, execute the template on some BibDesk entries sorted by year, and
execute them in a sage notebook. 

 Download it at <a
