#### A careful search reveals the following publications and mentions of tatami tilings in mathematics:

Mitsuyoshi Yoshida, Japan 1641, Jinkōki ( translated as “Inalterable Treatise”,
first published in 1627 according to
[britannica.com](http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/536726/Mitsuyoshi-Yoshida-as-discussed-in-East-Asian-mathematics
"Britannica Jinkōki")).

*   Knuth reprints a 6 x 5 dimer (1 x 2) tiling from Yoshida's text in The Art
    of Computer Programming

David Wolfe, Tom Rodgers, 2002, Puzzlers' Tribute: A Feast for the Mind.  Puzzle
by Yoshiyuki Kotani, Y2K problem of dominoes and tatami carpeting.

*   Some of this puzzle can be seen in the
    [Amazon.com preview for the hardcover, page 413](http://www.amazon.com/Puzzlers-Tribute-Feast-David-Wolfe/dp/1568811217#reader_1568811217
    "Preview").  The puzzle seen in the preview is: Find a shape that has
    exactly 2000 domino tatami tilings.

*   Following Ruskey and Woodcock, this paper treated tilings with exactly one
    monomer (1 x 1).  It motivates further the study of arbitrary monomers but
    was written prior to our discovery of their structure.

    tilings of rectangular regions.
*   Maximum number of monomers in an $r x c$ tiling is max(r,c) or max(r,c)+1
    and has parity the same as rc.
*   The number of $n\times n$ tilings with $n$ monomers is $n2^{n-1}$.

    generating function.

grids, in
22nd [International Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms, University of Victoria, June 20-22](http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/%7Ewendym/IWOCA/IWOCA_2011.html
"IWOCA 2011"), volume 7056 of <span class="s1">Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS)</span>, Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 2011, p. 12 pages.

*   Abstract:     We prove that the number of monomer-dimer tilings of an $n\times n$  
    square grid, with $m<n$ monomers in which no four tiles meet at any  
    point is $m2^m+(m+1)2^{m+1}$, when $m$ and $n$ have the same parity.  
    In addition, we present a new proof of the result that there are  
    $n2^{n-1}$ such tilings with $n$ monomers, which divides the tilings  
    into $n$ classes of size $2^{n-1}$.  The sum of these over all $m\le  
    n$ has the closed form $2^{n-1}(3n-4)+2$ and, curiously, this is equal  
    to the sum of the squares of all parts in all compositions of $n$.

*   We are given a rectangular grid with certain symbols.  The goal is to find a
    certain subdivision of the grid into rectangles which satisfies the tatami
    condition.  My own post about this puzzle is [here]({{site.baseurl}}{%
    post_url 2010-09-16-050-a-tatamibari-solvability-question %} "Tatamibari
    solvability").

 2010 Frank
Ruskey, Alejandro Erickson

*   Players take turns adding tiles to a rectangular grid.  They must not
    violate the tatami condition and the first player with no available move
    loses.

*   The player must reconstruct a tatami tiling given its row and column
    projections.

[Tatami dots and boxes]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url
2010-10-23-063-tatami-dots-and-boxes %} "Tatami dots and boxes"), 2010,
Alejandro Erickson, Gwen Temmel

*   Played just like
    [dots and boxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes "Dots and Boxes
    on Wikipedia") except that no four lines may touch at any point.

Water striders, Frank Ruskey, Alejandro Erickson, Brian Wyvill

*   Players place x shaped pieces which must not overlap.  The first player with
    no available move loses.  This is inspired by the rays formed by the tatami
    configurations called bidimers and vortices and the desire to pack them.

There is another puzzle due to Knuth I think, with 1x3 tiles, but I don't
remember where I saw it.
