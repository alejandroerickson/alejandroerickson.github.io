title: Kickstarting Coffee in a Post-Industrial Wasteland

As I prepared to move to the UK three years ago, there was one thing I knew for
certain: It is not (yet) a coffee culture. Much less so is the
post-industrial wasteland that I have moved to. So, being the coffee enthusiast
that I am, I bought a [nice espresso machine](https://londiniumespresso.com/) to
ensure my family's survival.

To be fair, the UK is a diverse place, with many serious coffee spots. I have
had wonderful coffee at [ Brew Lab ](http://www.brewlabcoffee.co.uk/),
[ Takk ](http://takkmcr.com/), [ North Tea Power ](http://northteapower.co.uk/),
and [ Quarter Horse Coffee ](http://quarterhorsecoffee.com/). The best espresso
shot I have *ever* had was a Kenya that tasted like fresh garden blueberries, at
[ Artisan Roast ](http://www.artisanroast.co.uk/pages/broughton-street), in
Edinburgh. But I don't live in those places. I live near Newcastle Upon Tyne, in
a small coal mining village with no mine, and there is one glimmering Beacon of
light that keeps the dream of bringing a true coffee shop culture to this corner
of England alive. It is [Flat Cap Joe's](http://www.flatcapscoffee.com/) coffee
shop.

This post is about Kickstarting Flat Caps' second shop, but let me explain what
I mean by "not a coffee culture". I have never seen a coffee shop open past
7:30pm, and I'm checking the local Starbucks' hours as I write this. At least
one specialty coffee shop in Newcastle closes at 3:30pm on Saturdays, and Flat
Whites, in Durham, doesn't open at all on Mondays. On Mondays! Certain Starbucks
shut down their filter coffee machines before 5 and then serve americanos
instead, because there aren't enough customers to keep it fresh. And if you
think you live in a UK city with a good coffee culture, count the number of
times you hear a foreign accent at the specialty coffee shops; you probably have
a bias in your sample of coffee lovers.

Flat Caps is owned and operated by Joe Meagher, who displays a collection of
Barista Championship trophies at his service counter. Below is an image that I
stole off his website without permission.

Joe bootstrapped his shop about 6 years ago with a bit of money from his former
job in banking, and has made a serious oasis of coffee in downtown Newcastle.
The best coffee in Newcastle is found descending a spiral staircase to the
basement of a shop full of esoteric, spiritual trinkets. The quiet, friendly
atmosphere, away from the business of the major shopping promenade above, make
it the perfect getaway. But greater things can be done when your opening hours
are not controlled by a trinket shop, and your outside visibility isn't limited
to a sign the size of a computer monitor.

## It's time for Flat Caps to open a second shop

If you are a coffee evangelist, you can help spread the message in this dark
land because Joe is

Back up Flat Caps's Kickstarter Campaign today. You'll feel good because you
helped expand the reach of specialty coffee beyond its current borders, and you
helped a hard-working man who left banking to do something interesting and
rewarding, and to give back to his home-town community.

I backed Flat Caps, and I won't even be in the UK by the time it opens. Coffee
matters that much to me.
