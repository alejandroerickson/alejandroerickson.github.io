<p>I will sell this by dutch auction, starting at $150, and reducing by $5 each week. You never know who's waiting for it to come down, so buy it quick!</p>

<p>This is a "Hexastix", shaped into a "Stellated Rhombic Dodecahedron". It casts a beautiful shadow, and belongs in a sunny window where the light hits something behind it. You'll need to remember that if you buy it. :)</p>
<p>I make all of my sculptures in a small rented workshop in Victoria, BC, where I am a PhD candidate at the University of Victoria.</p>
<p>Beauty in mathematics, especially geometric beauty, is an ongoing passion. The asking price of this sculpture is very low, but it is worth selling, just to know someone else is in love with it.</p>
