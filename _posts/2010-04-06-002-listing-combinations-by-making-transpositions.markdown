Suppose you have an apple, an orange, a banana, a pineapple a grape and a
screwdriver and you _choose_ to take exactly 3 of these things.  This is called a
_3-combination_ of a 6-set, because you chose 3 of the 6 things.  Now suppose you
want a different set of 3 things by putting one thing back and taking another. 
Easy, right?

For some inexplicable reason, however, you want to hold _every_ set of three
things exactly once and each time you change, you want to swap _one_ item in your
hand for one on the table.  _Is this even possible?!?_

The short answer is yes.  And I've animated it for you!  Look at it like this: 
The colour of the balls in the animation indicates whether the thing in that
position has been chosen.  Swapping a red ball in position 2 and a blue ball in
position 6 simply indicates that the second item was swapped with the fifth item.

Without further ado, enjoy my first ever flash animation.
