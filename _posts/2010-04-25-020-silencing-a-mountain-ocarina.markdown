My recent and fantastic purchase of
[this musical instrument](http://www.mountainsocarina.com/ocarinas.htm#polycarbonateg
"MO Key of G polycartbonate") has made me an unwitting oppressor.  This ocarina is
made to play loudly, filling the space you are playing in and matching the volume
of other instruments without the need for amplification.  It also fills all four
of the units in my house.  For some reason, Karl made a
[30 minute video on this](http://vimeo.com/2460730 "30 minutes of Karl"), which I
have not watched in its entirety (actually I'm watching it now and it's hilarious,
but not as useful as the one I made).  Instead, I took two minutes and a straw to
make the silencer in the video below.  Enjoy!
