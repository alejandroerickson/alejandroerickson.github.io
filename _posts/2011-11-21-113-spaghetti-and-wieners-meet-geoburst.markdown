<p>I recently saw a picture of some spaghettis stuck in pieces of wieners, and the results were these cute little lumps with floppy tails sticking out.  "So much potential," I thought.  Here are the results of my first geometric crafts using spaghetti and wieners.  This is definitely something I can bring to a nerdy event.</p>
<p>I tried to make a hyperboloid too, but didn't have enough materials left.  Some thoughts for the future though...</p>
