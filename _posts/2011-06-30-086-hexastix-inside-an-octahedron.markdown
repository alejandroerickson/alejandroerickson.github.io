<p>I have completed a project that I conceived at <a href="http://canadam.math.ca/2011/" title="CanaDam">CanaDam, the Canadian Discrete Math Conference</a> at the <a href="http://www.uvic.ca/" title="University of Victoria">University of Victoria</a>.  After getting the geometry wrong once, and making several smaller prototypes, I have finally made one as large as possible, given the dimensions of the laser cutter at the MakerSpace in Victoria, BC.</p>
<p>The sculpture is made of clear acrylic and skewers that have been coloured with <a href="http://www.ritdye.com" title="Rit Dye">Rit Dye</a>.  The pedestal is a boxed set of Knuth's, "The Art of Computer Programming", volumes 1-3, third edition.</p>

<p>I hope to suspend it and project its shadow onto a screen.  More photos will follow in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>When I am finished, the Hexastix in an Octahedron will go to auction, and part of the proceeds will go to <a href="http://www.oxfam.ca/" title="Oxfam">Oxfam</a></p>
