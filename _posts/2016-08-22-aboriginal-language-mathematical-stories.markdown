In 2012-2013 I travelled to several remote First Nations communities around
British Columbia to do hands-on mathematical activities with elementary school
kids and teachers. [Math Catcher](http://mathcatcher.irmacs.sfu.ca/), which
provided the free math presentations, has also born several mathematical stories
about a young boy, named
[Small Number](http://mathcatcher.irmacs.sfu.ca/content/small-number), that have
been translated into Aboriginal languages from across Canada. I have embedded
all of Small Number's stories and translations here (updated 31
August 2016) for your ears to enjoy the sound of these languages.
