I have built tensegrities with nearly 1000 kids this year, and it keeps me quite busy.  I finally found a moment to work out how to make a (approximate) module of the Needle Tower out of my materials.  The result is fairly wobbly, of course, so it works better as an arc than a tower.  Here is the first picture, and you can look forward to an instructable!
