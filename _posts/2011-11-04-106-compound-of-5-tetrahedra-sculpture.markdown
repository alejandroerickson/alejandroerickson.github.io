<p>I got hopelessly lost the first time I tried to make this, but with a bit of patience and some images from the article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_of_ten_tetrahedra">Wikipedia</a>, I have come out of it one Compound of 5 Tetrahedra richer.</p>
<p>Here is an animated GIF of the model.  It will be available to buy on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/geoburst">Etsy</a> as soon as I have taken the proper photographs.</p>

<p>Each of the five tetrahedra is a different colour, so that the colouring has the same properties as the one in my <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/84998491/a5-symmetry-icosahedron-for-display-and">coloured icoshedrons</a> (correct me if I'm wrong here!).</p>
<p>I am available to teach people how to make things like this (though this one is for the nimble and patient), and I also colour sticks for such purposes.  Please contact me with the information on this website.</p>
