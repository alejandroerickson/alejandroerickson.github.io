This year I set out to learn about investing and trading on the stock market. I
signed up for a
[practice account on Questrade](http://www.questrade.com/api/free-practice-account)
which comes with a healthy supply of fake cash and started making pretend
trades. Pretty soon I realized that I needed a written comprehensive plan, complete with
a strategy and specific shares that I want in my portfolio. **Google spreadsheets to the rescue!**

I found a spreadsheet that serves as a starting point on
[Dough Roller](https://www.doughroller.net/investing/an-awesome-and-free-investment-tracking-spreadsheet/)
and added support for multiple accounts and account types.

### [Here is a direct link to the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c6L3ajeqc4DZz_78sgontmHlIdfHtFsrRsCGWkBRcoc/edit?usp=sharing) ###

The spreadsheet provides a summary of your holdings by account type and asset
type, where you can also view the difference between your portfolio allocation
and your target allocation.

    title="Account Balances by Asset Type."
    caption="Account Balances by Asset Type."
    %}
    
Below the account summary there is also a visual representation of your target and actual allocations.

{% include image.html
    img="/images/portfolio-planning-target-and-allocation.png"
    title="Porfolio Target and Actual Allocation."
    caption="Porfolio Target and Actual Allocation."
    %}
    
Actual holdings are specified on the holdings page by giving a ticker symbol and number of shares owned.

    title="Portfolio Share Holdings."
    caption="Portfolio Share Holdings."
