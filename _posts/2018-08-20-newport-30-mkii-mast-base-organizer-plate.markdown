title: 'Newport 30 mkii Mast Base Organizer Plate'

My main sheet and vang used to connect to a simple eye near the base of the mast until one day the threads gave way and it popped out.

Whether it was my fault or not I don't know, since I didn't see it happen, but
now that I have to fix it I'd like to make it and the halyard organizer more
robust, by replacing them both with a mast-base organizer plate.  I envision something like the plate pictured below, but without the hinge.

From the picture of my own mast base, it looks like I already have some sort of aluminum casting at the foot of my mast, so if I unstep the mast and successfully remove the casting, I should be able to slip a plate underneath it... Let's hope I can get it off!

I'll update this post as the project moves forward.
