<p>Enjoy these nice and peaceful sounds of seaside camp fire and gentle waves.  I recorded 10 minutes of sound from the ocean and fire during a February  camping trip on the Juan de Fuca trail, on Vancouver Island, BC,  Canada.  It was beautifully peaceful and a wonderful sound to sleep to.   I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.</p>
