<p>Last fall I made Tomoku into a book with 80 pen-and-paper puzzles based on the web game at <a href="http://tomokupuzzle.com" title="Tomoku!">http://tomokupuzzle.com</a>.  Four months later I have not found a market for it, and I am looking for the lessons I need to learn.</p>
<p>The book is professionally printed, and the instructions are brief.  Many people compliment me on the "look" of the thing.  But it only goes skin deep.</p>
<p>Some people read the instructions, and then demonstrate to me that they misunderstood everything I wrote down.  Tomoku is a puzzle I find very intuitive, and some people understand the rules perfectly.  Perhaps you can suggest some clarifications?  <a href="images/pdf/TomokuInstructions.pdf" title="Tomoku Instructions">Here are the instructions as they appear in the book</a>.</p>
<p>Those who understand the rules think the concept is interesting, but they aren't hooked by the game.  Why is sudoku interesting?  Or other logic games?</p>
<p>I still believe that the Tomoku players are out there, and either I have not found them yet, or I have not communicated with them correctly.  Perhaps the pen-and-paper format is not the right one?  Maybe it would do better as a mobile app or a physical board game.</p>
<p>I want to hear what you think!</p>
<p>Here are two videos explaining Tomoku, with instructions on making a game board for it.</p>
