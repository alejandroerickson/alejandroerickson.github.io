I transformed my PhD work into a 5-day mini course for Grade 10s through
[The Brilliant Club](http://www.thebrilliantclub.org/). I am making the course
material available here. Contact me or write in the comments for more resources
and help using them!

Below is an excerpt of a case study that I wrote for The Brilliant Club:

> My Scholars Programme, “How to Make a Mathematical Discovery,” is designed to
> introduce the idea that maths is much bigger than practicing algebra and
> arithmetic, or applying such concepts to solve real-life problems. Research
> mathematics is also about exploring ideas, identifying patterns, and connecting
> concepts through mathematical abstraction. Why do mathematicians see a teacup
> and a donut as being the same thing? (Hint: consider the handle). My course
> gives pupils the opportunity to rediscover the main theorem of my PhD thesis by
> playing with a set of 3D-Printed tiles, specially designed for the programme.
> Not a single equation is solved and not a single expression is evaluated.

> The outcome of the course was generally positive, in spite of it being
> conceptually challenging. All 12 of my pupils submitted their final illustrated
> essay assignment and passed the course, six of them with 1sts, two with
> distinction, and a third pupil will have her assignment published in The
> Scholar. I am extremely proud of them! These quotes speak for themselves: “I’ve

Congratulations to Katie Hancock. Her work on tatami tilings were published in
The Brilliant Club's journal,
[The Scholar](http://www.thebrilliantclub.org/category/the-scholar/)!

There are a few other handouts that I can locate upon request. Below is an
excerpt from the last activity before the final project (*i.e.*, Katie Hancock's
work, above), showing how far the students go in just a short time.
