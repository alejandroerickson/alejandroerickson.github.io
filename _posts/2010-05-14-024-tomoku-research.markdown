I often get ahead of myself and I'm going to do it here.  With no introduction to
tatami tilings nor to tomography and not to mention, their intersection, I present
[this](http://www.alejandroerickson.com/joomla/tatami/tomoku_research.html
"TomOku! Research") flash application.

I appreciate your comments and bug reports (post them here if you like). 
Apologies for the jumbled user interface, I'll update that stuff if and when I
realize that someone other than me and a couple of friends want to play with it.

Try the following:  Press "Random Tiling" and then press "Tomography".  Read the
instructions that appear at the bottom right and see how fast you can place all
the mats onto the grid.  Note that 1x1 mats appear twice (you'll see why when you
place one).

Without further ado:
