In my sculpting endeavours I have needed many coloured sticks of all shapes and
sizes.

It was immediately apparent that I would need to

*   source skewers in bulk,
*   cut them quickly without fraying them,
*   and colour them cheaply.

The useful answer to the first item, is that skewers are available in bulk from
"box and paper" companies.  Next item please.

One of the best tools I have ever purchased is a stack paper cutter from
[All Image Printing](http://allimageprinting.com/paper_cutter.html#x005 "Paper
Cutters").  I got the little 12 inch one for $140, delivered.  I see the price
has risen considerably.  Cutting skewers is just one thing I have done with
this.

Lastly, I use RIT Dye to colour them.  The colours are beautifully strong, and
the process is quite simple.

Here is a picture of part of my latest project; colouring 15,000 sticks, each 3
inches in length.  This project is for a bulk order, where I will facilitate
several more Hexastix activities, like
[the one I did at Math Camp, at the University of Victoria, in Summer 2011.]({{site.baseurl}}{%
