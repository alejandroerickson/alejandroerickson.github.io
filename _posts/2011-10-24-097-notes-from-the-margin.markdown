<p>I am pleased to announce the publication <a href="images/pdf/CMSS_newsletterSEPT11_v9.pdf"><strong>Japanese tatami mat tilings: No four tiles meet</strong></a>, in the Notes from the Margin, Volume II, 2011, from the Student Committee of the Canadian Mathematical Society.</p>
<p>The title of the newsletter comes from the story behind Fermat's last theorem.  He had written in the margins of his notebook:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic; line-height: 19px;">it is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general, any power higher than the second, into two like powers. I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_Last_Theorem">wikipedia</a>)</span></p>
<p>This article is a condensed version of a result in the conference proceedings: A. Erickson, M. Schurch, 2011: Enumerating tatami mat arrangements of square grids, in 22nd <a href="http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/%7Ewendym/IWOCA/IWOCA_2011.html" title="IWOCA 2011">International Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms, University of Victoria, June 20-22</a>, volume 7056 of <span class="s1">Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)</span>, Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 2011, p. 12 pages.</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">Tatami mats are the type of mats used in traditional Japanese rooms. Often, an arrangement in which four mats meet at a point is considered unlucky, perhaps because the word “four” sounds like the word “death” in Japanese. So, a “lucky” layout has no “+” shapes formed by the lines where mats meet. Compare the following two arrangements.</p>
<p class="p1">Tatami tilings are accessible and fun, so go ahead and take a gander!</p>
