<p>Rachel Peters is an artist, performer and animator and filmmaker.  <a href="http://rachelpeters.com/bio/" title="Rachel Peters">Raised by bumblebees in an old abandoned mineshaft</a>, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Jack</span> Rachel learned all of her trades as a court jester to the Queen Bee.  Now and then the Queen would get tired of a jester (or a couple) and have them "repurposed" (Yes, now I'm just making this up).  Initially repulsed by the procedure, Rachel eventually became fascinated by the way a few old, unwanted bees could be be transformed into brand new hilariously transformed into very entertaining Frankenstein bees!</p>
<p>After years of incubation (of the idea), Rachel has applied this idea to vintage toys and made these works of art <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/frankentoys" title="Etsy Shop Franken Toys">available at Etsy</a> and some new designs<a href="http://rachelpeters.com/franken-toys-up-for-adoption/1745/" title="Franken Toys up for adoption"> on her website</a>.  These little (must they always be little?) critters are one-of-a-kind and up for adoption by any queen bee with about 25-100 bucks.</p>
