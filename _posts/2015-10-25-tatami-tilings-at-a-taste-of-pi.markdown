[![Tatami Tilings at A Taste of Pi]({{site.baseurl}}/images/a-taste-of-pi.jpg)](https://www.sfu.ca/math/Events_and_News/NewsStories/tasteofpi.html "Tatami Tilings at A Taste of Pi")

Last week I gave an interactive presentation on tatami tilings to senior high
school students. It was very well received, and a long-time attendee raved about
it. I paraphase the keen student's words, "I've been to almost every A Taste of
Pi presentation, and I think this has been my favourite one so far. It was
engaging, interactive, and challenging."

The event was written-up on the Simon Fraser University math department's
[news page](https://www.sfu.ca/math/Events_and_News/NewsStories/tasteofpi.html).
Here is an excerpt:

> If you're in high school, it's not everyday that you have the chance to receive
> a lecture from a postdoctoral research associate.
> 
> But, for a group of extraordinary students, they had just such an opportunity,
> when Dr. Alejandro Erickson from the School of Engineering and Computing
> Sciences at Durham University gave a presentation on mathematical discovery at
> the Burnaby campus as part of the 24th edition of the A Taste of Pi speaker
> series.
