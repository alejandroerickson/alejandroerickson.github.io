<h3>Do you like fog machines?  Do you like fog machines that can go in your pocket?</h3>
<p>That is what an e-cigarette is.  A fog machine that produces fog when you suck on it.  The "e-liquid" is actually the same, or a very similar chemical to the one found in fog machines.  And they work the same way (save for the sucking).  Current is delivered to a resistance heating wire that is in contact with the chemical.  The chemical then vapourizes and makes the fog.</p>
<p>I have converted the e-cig cartridge so that it draws power from a wall wart power adaptor, and is activated by a button.  With a good battery, you could have one of these in your coat pocket!</p>
<h3>Here is some info on it:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Basic pushbutton switch circuit.</p>
<p>Greensmoke E-cig cartridge refilled with vegetable glycerin.  Inside it, a wire gets red hot, and vapourizes the glycerin.</p>
<p>Solder wires on instead of battery.</p>
<p>Don't hack adaptors that you use for other things.  You are very likely to break burn them out or otherwise destroy them.  Read the output in volts and in mA.  A smoke machine uses heat, which means high amperage.  These adaptors are less common.</p>
<p>Adaptor output MUST deliver at least 2 Amps and at most 4.5 volts.  If not, this is like short circuiting it and could destroy it.</p>
<p>Do not use a switch that stays on - you could cause a fire.</p>
