<p>I had a word with Ron Graham at the <a href="http://math.ca/Events/winter10/" title="2010 CMS Winter Meeting">2010 CMS Winter Meeting</a> and he mentioned a <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbutler/ron/81_01_fault_free_tilings.pdf" title="Ron Graham, Fault-free tilings">short paper</a> of his in which he talks about fault-free dimer tilings.  A fault-free tiling of a rectangular grid is one in which every interior grid line intersects at least one tile.  Here is a 6 x 6 tiling with two faults.</p>

<p>Ron Graham gives a clever argument, due to S. W. Golomb and R. I. Jewett, that no 6 x 6 fault-free dimer tiling exists.  Try to prove it yourself! (hint:  a dimer blocks exactly one potential fault.  Use elementary arguments).</p>
<p>Let's ask the obvious question.</p>
<h2>For which dimensions r x c can we have fault free tatami-dimer tilings?</h2>
<p>The answer is simple.  It never happens, except, in the 1 x 2 rectangle.  I'll allow you to convince yourself (in keeping with the low production value of this post) by looking at this:</p>

<p>Dimer tatami tilings of rectangles are all compositions of these configurations.  Since their compositions create fault lines, we may assume that a fault-free tiling has a single bidimer (the configuration in the middle).  But each of these clearly has at least one fault line too.</p>
<p>(disclaimer:  I'm posting this before I'm done thinking about it.  If you want to cite it you should contact me and I'll write a better proof)</p>
