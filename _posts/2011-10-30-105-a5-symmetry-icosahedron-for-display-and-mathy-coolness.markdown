<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">These vividly colored icosahedrons look great when hung from the ceiling, or a wall, but the fun doesn't stop there. You'll notice that the colors seem to follow a pattern which is quite amazing.Â <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" />I'll skip over the cool math that is involved, but try holding two opposite nodes still, and spin it by 1/5 of a rotation. What happens to all the yellows? All the greens? etc. Maybe I'll make a video about it later!<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" />My icosahedrons are made using colored skewers that are held together with wire. It is not glued, but the whole thing is dipped in acrylic medium to give it a nice shiny finish. They are very durable and can be kicked around the house without breaking (don't try too hard though, ok?)</span></p>
