This week I had the pleasure of teaching a Hexastix workshop to a group of
volunteer mathematics educators, at the invitation of the [2011 PIMS Education
Prize winner, Veselin
Jungic](http://www.pims.math.ca/news/sfus-veselin-jungic-awarded-2011-pims-education-prize
"2011 PIMS Education Prize winner, Veselin Jungic").  As with my previous
experience teaching Hexastix at Math Camp, these beautiful mathematical objects
will be the take-home project for students participating in Small Number, a
program for First Nations math education.

[Small Number](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~vjungic/SmallNumber.html "Small
Number") is not precisely the name of the program, but of the protagonist in the
associated animation, which is narrated in Blackfoot, Cree, and English on
YouTube (embedded below). If you have never heard Blackfoot or Cree, I strongly
suggest you listen to those versions. The languages are moving and sounds
fascinating. [Here is a language map](http://maps.fphlcc.ca/ "First Nation's
Languages"), just to give you an idea of how many First Nations languages there
are in British Columbia (I'm as amazed as you are!).

The animation and the school workshop program are products of [several meetings
at the Banff International Research Station beginning in November
2006](http://www.birs.ca/events/2009/5-day-workshops/09w5078 "First Nations Math
at BIRS").  There, First Nations communities have partnered with math
educators to assess the performance of First Nations students in mathematics,
and to find ways of providing them with more opportunities to learn it.  The
data presented at the workshop shows, for example, that "Over the last seven
years, only 5-7 percent of Aboriginal students have written and passed the
Principles of Mathematics 12 provincial exam, compared to 25-27 percent of
non-Aboriginal students."

My part is to provide the program with [15,000 coloured sticks]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url
2011-09-20-100-coloured-craft-sticks %} "Coloured craft sticks"), as
well as other materials, and teach their volunteers how to make Hexastix. I
used my [blog post about it as a visual guide to my workshop]({{ site.baseurl
}}/2011/09/27/090-how-to-make-hexastix-detailed-photo-instructions.html
"Hexastix Instructions").  The volunteers were challenged, and they enjoyed
themselves.  Here are some pictures of our workshop.

My first real math course - real analysis, in my case - was given by Dr. Jungic
in 2004.  His other students and I like to recall how he explained
infinitesimals by saying "small small small small", and motioning with his
hands, and then he would describe large numbers by saying "HUGE" and throwing up
his hands.
