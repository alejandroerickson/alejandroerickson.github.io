This collection features man-made objects that have become unintentional foci.

Layers placed upon layers of walls, and posters, and signs and sidewalks, which have weathered, cracked, left the faintest traces of their existence, and then been reinstalled, looking like a stack of insurance stickers on a car's license plate.

They may draw our attention or tell a story - sometimes untrue - but no one ever meant them to. I have tried to capture a few examples, and I hope viewers will be inspired to find their own unwitting works of art, outside and even in their own home.

I plan on posting a few every week for a few weeks, as of October, 2013.
