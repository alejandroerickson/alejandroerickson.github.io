<p>I was at <a href="http://vancouver.makerfaire.ca/" title="Mini Makerfaire in Vancouver">Mini Makerfaire in Vancouver</a> last weekend, and I came across a booth presenting a very interesting vest.  The <a href="http://www.pointlocus.com/" title="Point Locus Wearable Tactile Pathfinder">Point Locus Wearable Tactile Pathfinder</a> is a vest which reads GPS data, and vibrates on the wearer's shoulders to indicate the direction they should take along a path to a destination.  The vest should be used in tandem with a guide dog or some other tool to navigate obstacles, whenever the device is used by the blind.</p>
