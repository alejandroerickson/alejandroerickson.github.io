## Starting with a thesaurus, here is a list of words synonymous with "walk".

stroll, saunter, amble, trudge, plod, dawdle, hike, tramp, tromp, slog, stomp, trek, march, stride, sashay, glide, troop, patrol, wander, ramble, tread, prowl, promenade, roam, traipse, stretch one's legs, mosey, hoof it, perambulate.

## Wanting a more general list, we brainstormed for other words.  Some may be repeated and some may be made up.

sprint run jog stampede stomp waltz saunter swoop scuttle walk scamper to wheel strut glide creep crawl skip skate gallop trot hobble roll sneak patter stride leap hop bounce scurry skidaddle slither slide swim waddle scanter

## I have three challenges for you.

1. At a party, play an improv game where you pick one of these words out of a hat and act out that type of ... ambulation
2. Make a video of yourself ambulating in one of the above ways, post it to YouTube and put the link in the comments here.
3. Contribute to the list!
