Over seven months after building my first Hexastix, a geometrical sculpture
introduced to me by [Matt DeVos](http://www.sfu.ca/~mdevos/ "Matt DeVos"), and
originally by [George Hart](http://www.georgehart.com/sculpture/pencils.html "72
Pencils"), I was finally graced with the opportunity to teach it to a group of
keen teenagers. My students, who were participants in
[Math Camp](http://www.math.ca/MathCamps/ "Math Camp") at the
[University of Victoria](http://www.math.uvic.ca/ "Dept Math UVic"), found the
activity very engaging and a bit challenging.  In the one hour time slot, each
of 16 students built a hexastix using approximately 48 3mm x 8cm coloured
skewers, and they continued to work eagerly through their 30 minute break to
expand their sculptures to about 72 skewers.

Producing high quality, colourful materials efficiently was the main challenge.
 Three millimetre thick skewers do not come in 8cm lengths, but skewers
typically fray when they are cut with a saw.  Efficient cutting was done with a
stack paper cutter, like the one at
[All Image Printing](http://allimageprinting.com/paper_cutter.html#x005 "All
Image Printing Stack Paper Cutter"), which cuts ten skewers at a time with
little to no fraying, and very little time between precise cuts. 
[Rit Dye](http://www.ritdye.com/ "Rit Dye") was used to colour the skewers.  It
is not food safe, of course, but the bold colours are magnificent compared to
results obtained with Kool-aid or food colouring.  Lastly, I provided small
elastics and white glue.

It takes just under one hour to get students started on the Hexastix, but
managing a large group is not difficult because students help each other.  I did
not have access to a data projector or document camera.  I am still working on
producing an instruction booklet for hexastix, however, I more or less followed
the method in a video I made a few months ago (below, using toothpicks rather
than skewers).  I emphasized that each colour represents a direction, and it is
important to be able to identify, at first, the first colour that was added.
 That colour has 7 sticks, which are separated by each other colour into sets of
2, 3, and 2 sticks (I made diagrams and showed them).  The most helpful type of
diagram was one of the ends of the first colour sticks, showing the directions
of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th colours, as they relate to the first.

The most difficult part is adding the first stick of the 4th colour, which is
shown in the video, above.  I had to do this for most of the students, but if I
had a data projector, or a prepared diagram or video, it would have been easier.

The Hexastix was a great ice breaker for math camp students, because they worked
in groups to help each other interpret the instructions.  Mixing colours, and
various options for shape and style allows for variety and innovation, while the
Hexastix structure gives direction and, optionally, some mathematics to teach
them.

I believe that the intersection of art and geometry is a great way to get many
young people keen on math.  A point that is frequently ignored in the teaching
of math at the pre-undergraduate level, is that higher math is in many ways a
creative art.  We impose rhythm and such on music, and various other aesthetics
on other creative arts.  In mathematics we impose logical rules, and try to find
"nice", and ever increasingly complex, statements that satisfy those rules.
 Perhaps geometric art is the pop music of math.  It pleases our eyes, and
sparks our curiosity.  It doesn't just lead more people to want to learn more
math, but it increases the appeal of math, garnering more allies for our cause.

### It was reported to me that the students said building the hexastix was their
favourite activity at math camp this year.
